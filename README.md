## Assumption Made 

1. Users are allowed to shift from 'todo' Column to 'Done' Column, there is no need to shift from 'toDo' to 'In Progress' to 'Done'
2. The application is not connected to any database, thus once the application is refreshed it would go back to the original with 2 tasks in the to do column.
